An Application for Smart farming.

## Getting Started

This project is a starting point for a Flutter application. Please try to run it using Android Studio, in order to understand the for each line of the code is working.

### Underatanding GoogleSignin in flutter

-[Create instance of google signin using this:]
 final GoogleSignIn _googleSignIn = GoogleSignIn();
 
-[Create a function for all the functionalities and add it in the on pressed of google button]
  
  Here when you'll read the code you ll see that each and every functionality that we are implementing
  we are saving it inside a type of variable, because whenever we  authenticate a user, it is a
  client server approach so, for every request we  make we receive a response and this response is
  what we save inside the variables for accessing it for the further functionality.
